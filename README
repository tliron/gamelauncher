=============
Game Launcher
=============

Game Launcher makes it easy to launch fullscreen games in a separate gaming
desktop. See this Ubuntu Forums post:

 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12438636

Please report bugs (please!!!) and get source code here:

The source code is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.
A copy of this license should have been included with the source code. It is

Ready-made Ubuntu packages for Game Launcher are available at this repository:

 https://launchpad.net/~emblem-parade/+archive/gamelauncher

==================
Build Dependencies
==================

You can install the build dependencies for Ubuntu via these make targets:

 "sudo make dependencies.quantal"
   Installs build dependencies for Ubuntu 12.10 (and above?).

 "sudo make dependencies.precise"
   Installs build dependencies for Ubuntu 12.04.
  
For other distributions, take a look at the "dependencies.mk" file and find the
equivalent packages.

Note that if you are building inside a pbuilder environment, build dependencies
will be automatically installed for you.

======================
Building Game Launcher
======================

These essential make targets are supported:

 "make all"
 "make clean"

Binaries will be in the "bin" directory.

You can also build individual components via these targets:

 "make gamelauncher"

To see only the C code output by the Vala compiler, use these targets:

 "make all.ccode"
 "make gamelauncher.ccode"
   Outputs the C code for a component into the "c/<component>" directory.

========================
Installing Game Launcher
========================

There is no "make install" target, but you can do a test install for your user
with these special targets:

 "make install.user"
   Installs a ".desktop" file and icons for the current user to run Game
   Launcher directly from the build's "bin" directory. DO NOT USE SUDO FOR
   THIS MAKE TARGET!

 "make uninstall.user"
   Undoes the above.

=======================
Ubuntu/Debian Packaging
=======================

Build and package for Ubuntu using these targets:

 "make deb"
   Creates Debian binary packages for Ubuntu.

 "make dsc"
   Creates Debian source packages for Ubuntu.

Set DEBSIGN_KEYID in order to sign the packages and the ".changes" files,
e.g.:

 "make deb DEBSIGN_KEYID=12345678"

All resulting files (".deb", ".dsc", ".changes", etc.) will be in the "debian"
directory. To clean them out:

  "make debian.clean"

To build using a pbuilder environment:

 "make deb.pbuilder"
   Same as "deb", but for the pbuilder environment.

Note that when using pbuilder all build dependencies will be automatically
installed.

========================
pbuilder in Ubuntu 12.04
========================

If you have an Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) pbuilder environment, you need to add
extra repositories for the build requirements. To do this, make sure the
following line is in your "~/.pbuilderrc" file:

OTHERMIRROR="deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/vala-team/ppa/ubuntu precise main"

You additionally need to add the keys for these repositories to APT. The
following commands should do it:

sudo pbuilder --login --save-after-login
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7DAAC99C
exit
sudo pbuilder --update --override-config

=======================
Debugging Game Launcher
=======================

Useful run options:

"G_DEBUG=fatal_warnings gdb gamelauncher"
   Breakpoint on logged warnings.
